# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Analyzing the Solow model** and is about examining the basic Solow model and the effects from changing different parameters. Futhermore we look at the extended version of the Solow model by including land and analyze the capital-output ratio.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages. To use the interactive element available in the notebook one must use Jupyter Notebook
