# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Income differences in Danish Municipalities** and examines the development in disposible income in the period 1987-2018. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

The project loads Average_income.xlsx downloaded from statistikbanken.dk/INDKP101

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation no further installations are required.
