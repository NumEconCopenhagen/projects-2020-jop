# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Income differences in Danish Municipalities** and examines the development in disposible income in the period 1987-2018. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

The project loads Average_income.xlsx ownloaded from statistikbanekn.dk/INDKP101

This **loades two datasets**:

1. INDKP101.xlsx downloaded from statistikbanekn.dk/INDKP101
1. RAS200.xlsx downloaded from statistikbanekn.dk/RAS200

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation no further installations are required.
