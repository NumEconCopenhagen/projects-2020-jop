# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Income differences in Danish Municipalities** and examines the development in disposible income in the period 1987-2018. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

The project loads Average_income.xlsx downloaded from statistikbanken.dk/INDKP106

**Dependencies:** For the interactive element in the notebook to work one must use jupyter lab and have the following package downloaded:
**jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager**
